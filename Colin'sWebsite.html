        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Colin Glavas, and I am a Senior at Jamestown High School, in Williamsburg, Virginia.
            I'm the starting shooting guard on the varsity team. This year, I was on the All-Region team. I averaged
            14 PPG, 7 RPG, and 6 APG right now as a senior in Boo Williams fall league and am looking to have a big senior season.
            I started coding as a Junior, and I have worked with various languages, like:
            <ul class="code">
                <li><h4>Python</h4></li>
                <li><h4>Java</h4></li>
                <li><h4>HTML</h4></li>
                <li><h4>CSS</h4></li>
                <li><h4>JavaScript</h4></li>
            </ul>
            I hope to earn a computer science degree in college. I also currently attend the Governor's School for Science and Technology.
            This is a school program for high academic students across 7 school districts in the 757. This is where i got introduced to programming,
            which is something that I really enjoy doing.
