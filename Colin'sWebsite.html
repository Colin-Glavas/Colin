            <h1>About Me:</h1>
            <h3>Academics:</h3>
            I am currently in the top 10% of my class at Jamestown High School. Jamestown is one of the best public schools in Virginia.
            I also attend the Governor's School for Science and Technology. This is a college program through TNCC.
            Many of the top students across 7 school districts apply to this program, and I was one of the 50 students selected.

            <h3>Basketball:</h3>
            I'm the starting shooting guard on the Jamestown varsity team. I've been on Varsity since freshman year. I am 6'5. I averaged
            15 PPG, 7 RPG, and 7 APG right now as a senior in Boo Williams fall league and am looking to have a big senior season.
            Last year, I averaged 13 PPG, 8 RPG, and 5 APG while being named 1st Team All-Region.

            <h3>Coding:</h3>
            I started coding as a Junior, and I have worked with various languages, like:
            <ul class="code">
                <li><h3>- Python</h3></li>
                <li><h3>- Java</h3></li>
                <li><h3>- HTML</h3></li>
                <li><h3>- CSS</h3></li>
                <li><h3>- JavaScript -</h3></li>
            </ul>
            I hope to earn a computer science degree in college.
            Programming is something that I really enjoy doing and hope to pursue a career in it.
